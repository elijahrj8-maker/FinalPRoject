# FinalPRoject

This repository now includes a minimal runnable Python script so you can verify everything is set up correctly.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or newer
- (Optional) A virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated

## Setup and run
1. **Clone or download the repository.**
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies (none required now, but this keeps the process consistent):**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
5. **Follow the prompt** to enter your name (or press Enter) and see the output.

## Next steps
- Extend `main.py` with the functionality you want to build.
- Add any external libraries to `requirements.txt` as your project grows.
- Update this README with more detailed usage instructions once features are added.
